## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API Key
- Weaviate instance (for vector search)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jatanrathod13/ai-fashion-stylist.git
   cd ai-fashion-stylist
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in your API keys:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys and configuration
   ```

5. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   python -m app.create_db
   ```

6. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

The API will be available at http://localhost:8000, and the API documentation can be accessed at http://localhost:8000/docs.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated and available at `/docs` when the application is running.

The main API endpoints include:

- `/api/users`: User management
- `/api/auth`: Authentication and token generation
- `/api/profiles`: Style profile management
- `/api/images`: Image upload and analysis
- `/api/recommendations`: Fashion recommendations
